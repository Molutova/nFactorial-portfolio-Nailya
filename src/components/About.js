        Hey, I’m Nailya, junior frontend developer
      </h4>

        I started learning programming half a year ago and I really like it. I
        work as a recruiter in an IT company and decided that I don’t want to
        hire people, but to be the one who is hired. I want to become a skilled
        developer and my dream is to get into the FAANG companies like many
        others. I'm still at the beginning of my career path. Here you can
        explore my projects, which will be regularly updated in the future.
